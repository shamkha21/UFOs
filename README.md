# UFOs 
Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to include filters for the city, state, country and shape. This allowed a more user friendly webpage. 

# Results 
 
How to use the search is self explanatory. Within the webpage on the left hand side of the page is a "Filter Search"

To utulize the search filter, you can insert the criteria of your liking for example: For example, "City: El Cajon", "State: CA", and if you need entering the "Country" and "Shape". 
 
# Summary  
 
One drawback of this page was if the user has a spelling mistake the correct output will not populate. One recommendation I have is to allow there to be a drop down menu the user can pick from. Another would be include a "Seach" button instead of having the user click enter, or having the option of both.
